# Rockets
Repo for Space Pickles Rocketry team tryouts

This repository was created to consistently update code to ensure originality and the process of software development

The purpose of this project is to create a simulation with a PID controller for the rocket, simulate random bursts of airstream as the rocket goes up, and adjust servos/fins to meet the error that the rocket has in order to keep it going straight up, all while visualizing all data streams of the rocket.
